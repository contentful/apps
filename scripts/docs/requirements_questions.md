I can see from the README that you have a Contentful space setup script that automates creating app definitions, spaces, team assignments, and app installations. Converting this to a CLI tool for marketplace developers is a great idea!

Let me help you think through the requirements. Based on the current script, here are some key areas to consider:

## Current Script Analysis
Your script currently:
- Creates app definitions in Contentful organizations
- Creates production and staging spaces
- Assigns teams with admin privileges
- Installs apps in both spaces
- Requires manual configuration of variables in the code

## Requirements to Consider

### 1. **Command Line Interface Design**
- How do you want users to provide the required parameters (access token, org ID, app name, team ID)?
- Should it be interactive prompts, command line flags, config files, or a combination?
- Do you want different commands for different operations (create-spaces, install-app, etc.) or one unified command?

### 2. **Configuration Management**
- Should users be able to save configurations for reuse?
- Do you want environment-specific config files?
- How should sensitive data like access tokens be handled?

### 3. **User Experience**
- What level of technical expertise do your target users have?
- Should there be validation of inputs before making API calls?
- Do you want progress indicators for long-running operations?

### 4. **Error Handling & Recovery**
- What should happen if a space already exists?
- How should API errors be presented to users?
- Should there be rollback capabilities?

### 5. **Distribution & Installation**
- How do you want to distribute this tool (npm, homebrew, standalone binary)?
- Should it be installable globally or run locally?

Could you tell me more about:
1. **User workflow**: How do marketplace developers currently use the script, and what pain points exist?
2. **Flexibility needs**: Do different apps require different configurations, or is it mostly standardized?
3. **Integration**: Does this need to integrate with other tools in your workflow?

This will help me create a more targeted technical spec for your CLI tool.
