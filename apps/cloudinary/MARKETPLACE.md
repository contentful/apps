Integrates with [Cloudinary's](https://cloudinary.com/) dynamic asset management platform. It allows you to browse media in a project on Cloudinary.

If you're looking to use this extension, head over to the [Marketplace](https://www.contentful.com/developers/marketplace/cloudinary-assets/) to install it into your Contentful space.

The IDs of selected media is then stored in Contentful. Clients can then easily fetch content from Contentful and resolve all needed details on media by using the IDs to fetch binaries or meta data from Cloudinary's API.
