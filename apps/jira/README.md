Jira App
===

## Local Development

In order to develop locally Jira App you need to run locally both the Jira Contentful 
Application (living in `jira-app`), and the Lambda functions (in `functions`) which handle 
[Atlassian's OAuth Flow](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/oauth/).

Technologies involved are:
* [serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless):
to run the Lambda function on your machine by means of the 
[offline plugin](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline)
* [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/):
to create a public URL to be used as OAUTH URI


### Launching the script

Launching the application locally namely means

```
npm run dev
```

This script expects the following environment variables to be set

| Variable                      | Description                                                               |
| ---                           | ---                                                                       |
| `ATLASSIAN_APP_CLIENT_ID`     | Client Id of the Atlassian Application you will use for local development |
| `ATLASSIAN_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client Secret of the same Atlassian Application                           |

Parameters above can be retrieved from Atlassian Developer Portal after setting 
up an Atlassian Application as per the following section.

* Add `Jira platform REST API` 
* Enable all the permissions (this is going to be only local, so doesn't matter)
* Click on `OAuth 2.0 (3LO)`

in the Callback URL

### Caveats
* Everytime you restart the development script it regenerates the Ngrok URL, so you need to 
redo last step of the list above
