This project was bootstrapped with [Create Contentful App](https://github.com/contentful/create-contentful-app).

## Overview

The Wistia app connects your Wistia projects to Contentful, allowing you to add a new field for Wistia videos. This field allows you to search through your Wistia videos, select the video you want to embed, and directly embed it without the need to copy an embed code from Wistia. You can also select which projects show up in Contentful, sharing only the videos you want to allow in your Contentful space.

## Requirements

To use this app, you will need:

- A Wistia account with at least one video, on any Wistia plan
- A Wistia read only API token allowing access to all project and video data
- A Contentful space on any plan
- A content type with a JSON field
