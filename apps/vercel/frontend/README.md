## Overview

This frontend module for the Vercel marketplace app was created using the Contentful App Framework.
To make the app look and feel like Contentful, Contentful's design system, [Forma 36](https://f36.contentful.com/), was leveraged.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Creates or updates your app definition in Contentful, and runs the app in development mode.
Open your app to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `npm run test`

Runs the spec files within the module, and remains in watch mode.
