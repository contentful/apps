# Development

## Local env setup

1. From root directory: `npm install`
1. From root directory: `npm run bootstrap` (if this fails because of something related to `typeform-frontend` then `rm -rf apps/typeform`)
1. Go to this project: `cd apps/mux` (no need to npm install again, because bootstrap already did that via lerna)
1. `npm start` - now the mux app is running on http://localhost:1234

**Notes**: `@contentful/dam-app-base` gets installed by lerna when running `npm run bootstrap` from the root directory. If you're getting errors related to this you should probably `rm -rf node_modules` from this project, cd back into the root and run `npm i && npm run bootstrap` again.

## Contentful app setup

* Use the Mux (dev) contentful app and make sure it is pointed to http://localhost:1234 for development
* You will have to go into your browser settings and disable mixed content warnings for this to work

## Deploy

* This gets deployed and hosted by Contentful
