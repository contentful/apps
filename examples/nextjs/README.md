This project was bootstrapped with [Create Contentful App](https://github.com/contentful/create-contentful-app).

## Config Location

Due to a bug in Next.js, the config location doesn't load in development mode. The bug has been reported in Next.js' GitHub repository: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/18028.
The config location works when creating a production build.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode. Open your app to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder. It correctly bundles Next in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. Your app is ready to be deployed!
