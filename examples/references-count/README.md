# Entry List location example
This example shows how to build an advanced app with an `EntryList` location. It counts a number of references for the entries.

## How to use

[![Install to Contentful](https://www.ctfstatic.com/button/install-small.svg)](https://app.contentful.com/deeplink?link=apps&id=50jZ722cWV7JOVj4SW10jI)

Or run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To test it locally, you can create an app definition in your Contentful organization settings pointing to `http://localhost:3000` and chosing the `Entry list` location from the proposed locations list.
