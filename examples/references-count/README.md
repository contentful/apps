# Entry List location example
This example shows how to build an advanced app with an `EntryList` location. It counts a number of references for the entries.

## How to use

Run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To test it, you can create an app definition in your Contentful organization settings pointing to `http://localhost:3000` and chosing the `Entry list` location from the proposed locations list.
