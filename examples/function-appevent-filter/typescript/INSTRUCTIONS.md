### Creating an app

You can create an app using CLI using `npm run create-app-definition`. This will prompt you to enter details for your new app and organization details. You can also create an app definition by [visiting the apps section](https://app.contentful.com/deeplink?link=app-definition-list) under your organization settings in the Contentful web UI and clicking on the "Create App" button on the top right.

### Using environment variables

You will need to set the following environment variables as listed below:

- `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN`: User management token used for authentication/authorization
- `CONTENTFUL_ORG_ID`: Organization id where the app lives under
- `CONTENTFUL_APP_DEF_ID`: App definition id for identifying the app

## Utilizing app event filter functions

When you create an app that utilizes [app events](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/app-framework/app-events/), you can define the entities and topics for these events. However, you may also want to do some additional filtering for these app events. For example, you might want to filter Entry events so that they are only sent for certain content types. App event filter functions are a flexible way of making app events even more powerful for your apps.
