# Page location example
This example shows how an app with a page location can be built. It creates a simple dashboard with information about your content and implements routing with `react-router-dom`.

## How to use

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
# or
yarn
yarn start
```

To test, you can create an app definition in your Contentful organization settings pointing to `http://localhost:1234` and registering both the `app-config` and `page` locations.
