# Contentful apps repository

This repository contains the source code for most apps on the [marketplace](https://www.contentful.com/marketplace/) and helpful resources to build your own apps for Contentful.

## Installing an app

Head over to the [marketplace](https://www.contentful.com/marketplace/) and follow the installation flow to set up any of the apps in your Contentful space.

## Building your own app

The best way to get started on app development is with our [tutorial](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/apps/building-apps/). After the tutorial, this repository contains great examples of different use cases that can be implemented with apps. You can follow their structure to develop similar integration patterns. If you want to start from scratch, check out our [`hello-world-react` example](examples/hello-world-react).

Detailed documentation can be found in the [App SDK documentation](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/ui-extensions/sdk-reference/) and the [Management HTTP API reference documentation](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/). 

Please note that each app has its individual source code license associated with it. Refer to the LICENSE file in the apps root folder.
