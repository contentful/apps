# Contentful apps repository

This repository contains the source code for most apps on the [marketplace](https://www.contentful.com/marketplace/) and helpful resources to build your own apps for Contentful.

This repository also includes two packages that help you developing your own apps:
* [dam-app-base](packages/dam-app-base)
* [ecommerce-app-base](packages/ecommerce-app-base)

## Installing an app

Head over to the [marketplace](https://www.contentful.com/marketplace/) and follow the installation flow to set up any of the apps in your Contentful space.

## Building your own app

The best way to get started on app development is with our [create-contentful-app](https://github.com/contentful/create-contentful-app) CLI tool.
This tool will bootstrap a brand new project with all the boilerplate code you need to start building an app.
If you are interested in learning how to build a simple example app, you can check out our [tutorial](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/apps/building-apps/).

Detailed documentation can be found in the [App SDK documentation](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/ui-extensions/sdk-reference/) and the [Management HTTP API reference documentation](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/). 

Please note that each app has its individual source code license associated with it. Refer to the LICENSE file in the apps root folder.
