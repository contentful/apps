# Agents Rules for Contentful Apps

## 1) Context & Scope

- This repo contains multiple **Contentful Apps** built with the **App Framework** (React + TypeScript).
- Apps are bundled with **Vite** and tested with **Vitest**.
- Apps must follow Contentful design and UX conventions using **Forma 36** components.
- Agents must:
  - Load the **entire repository** into context (not just a single app).
  - Prefer **reuse** of existing components, hooks, utilities, and patterns.
  - Respect the repository’s **ESLint / Prettier / TypeScript** configuration.
  - Suggest solutions aligned with **Vite** build tooling (avoid Webpack/CRA assumptions).

---

## 2) Golden Rules (TL;DR)

1. **Use React + TypeScript + Vite + Vitest + Forma 36** in all solutions.
2. **Use official Contentful SDKs and APIs** and reference documentation when proposing solutions.
3. **Inspect `package.json` first** in the workspace and app:
   - Reuse installed libraries and versions.
   - Add new dependencies only if required and provide justification.
4. **Do not use deprecated APIs** (Contentful, Forma 36, React, Vite, or other libraries).
5. **TypeScript strictness**: avoid `any` unless absolutely unavoidable; prefer precise types.
6. **Clean Code + SOLID principles**: small units, single responsibility, dependency inversion.
7. Prefer **small, incremental changes** with clear scope and checklists. Do not add changes that were not requested.
8. When commiting changes to git, create atomic commmits and use **Conventional Commits** (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## 4) Dependencies & Libraries Policy

- **Inspect `package.json`** in the target app.
- **Reuse** installed libraries and versions.
- **Do not introduce** new dependencies unless:
  - No adequate existing library is available, and
  - The ROI is clear (maintainability, reliability, performance).
- If adding a dependency, provide:
  - Short justification and rejected alternatives.
  - License, maintenance, and compatibility check.
  - Versioning consistent with repo conventions.
- **No deprecated APIs** (always check release notes).

---

## 5) TypeScript, Coding Standards & Architecture

- Follow standard TypeScript and React coding conventions.
- **TypeScript**
  - Avoid `any`. Use explicit, narrow types (interfaces, unions, generics).
  - Export types for public interfaces; keep internal types scoped.
- **Clean Code + SOLID**
  - Single Responsibility: each module does one thing.
  - Open/Closed: extend via composition.
  - Liskov, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion: stable boundaries, injected collaborators.
  - Clear names, small functions, shallow nesting.
- **Error handling & UX**
  - Fail gracefully with Forma 36 notifications and accessible messages.
  - Developer logs must be actionable, not user-facing stack traces.
- **Performance**
  - Optimize renders in React (memoization, hooks) only when profiling shows benefit.
- **Accessibility**
  - Use Forma 36 components (a11y-ready). Add labels/roles/alt text where required.

---

## 6) UI with Forma 36 (mandatory)

- Always use **Forma 36** components, tokens, spacing, and density rules.
- Avoid plain HTML and ad-hoc CSS; prefer F36 tokens for styling.
- Use Forma 36 icons and layout primitives for consistent spacing and typography.

---

## 7) Folder Organization

- All apps must reside in the `/apps` directory.
- Each app should be self-contained and avoid cross-app dependencies.

---

## 8) Testing Requirements

When adding tests:

- Use **Vitest** as the default testing framework.
- Use **React Testing Library** for component testing.
- What to test:
  - Cover critical logic paths and edge cases.
  - Prefer tests that resemble real user scenarios.
- Tests must run correctly under Vite + Vitest setup.

---

## 9) Code Suggestions scope

- Keep proposed code simple and to the point.
- UI matches **Forma 36** guidelines and accessibility requirements.
- Confirmed **no deprecated** methods by checking documentation.
- Propose to add tests after a code change

After adding or changing code, post a short explanation. Explanation must include:

- **Goal** (what changes and why)
- **Approach** (high level) + links to the exact SDK/API/F36 docs
- **Scope** (files/areas affected) and **dependencies** (reuse existing; propose new only if necessary)
